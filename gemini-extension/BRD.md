| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | AI guardian — real time fact checker  | Chrome | Useful and non-mainstream idea. Relatively original and easy to implement. | Might be hard to fact check without perplexity-like API, unless we correlate with multiple models. | [I built a Fact Checker for Perplexity Pro users : r/perplexity\_ai](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1e70gpf/i_built_a_fact_checker_for_perplexity_pro_users/) |  | Wenwen |
| 2 | AI Tab Organizer | Chrome | Useful for me.  | Not much complexity in terms of APIs we can use. | [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-tab-organizer/jkainmmmikpplcgoldknljjekkickecl?hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-tab-organizer/jkainmmmikpplcgoldknljjekkickecl?hl=en) |  | Eisa |
| 3 | Visual content extractor for visually challenged people | Chrome | Can use multi-modal inputs. | Most likely already offered in-built by browesrs | [Visual AI \- Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/visual-ai/kepijannnnbdahmnoedepeikgdjmimpf) |  | Eisa |
| 4 | Session summarizer | Chrome | Goes over all the tabs (and their content) you went over and summarizes and notes what we do. Useful for productivity and keeping track of everything i explored.  Could be useful for me. **Likely original idea and doesnt exist\!**  We can extend this to tell a story of your browsing and visualize that using graphs etc. | Need to read browser history.  | ? |  | Eisa |
| 5 | *^ Can extend above for time tracking on various kinds of tasks and categorization* | Chrome | Track productivity and browsing habits. |  |  |  | Eisa |
| 6 | *^ Can extend above for "contextual undo"* | Chrome | Close 5 tabs, extension pops up and shows summary of them. Reopen only useful ones.  |  |  |  | Eisa |
| 7 | *^ Can extend above for blocking distracting websites* | Chrome | Can input prompt from user "I want to block all news websites". Extension checks if website is news website, and redirects to Leetcode. |  |  |  | Eisa |
| 8 | Intent lens | Chrome | The extension tells you why this page exists \-- ad revenue, political leaning, hidden persuasion, etc... |  |  |  | Eisa |
| 9 | *^ Political spectrum extension* | Chrome | Tells you if news source is left or right wing, has history of disinformation etc. Can be extended to "AI guardian". |  |  |  | Eisa |
| 10 | AI Language learning | Chrome | Auto translate certain words/phrases into a langauge that you're learning, and then translate them back when you click them to learn. Similar project won a hackathon but it's not exactly the same as what I describe. |  | [GitHub \- gabrieldeolaguibel/GenAI-Hackathon: Parrot: An AI language learning chrome extension.](https://github.com/gabrieldeolaguibel/GenAI-Hackathon) |  | Eisa |
| 11 | Superwizard | AWS | [Superwizard](https://www.superwizard.ai/) \- idea exists, it auto fills forms on browsers. **Explore more automation tasks.** |  |  |  |  |
| 12 | Search histor RoadMap (kinda like the session summary above) But it display the history in a map and use AI to expand more | Chrome | Track history search and expand knowledge/ information on top of that |  |  |  | wenwen |
| 13 | Our AI cross-verification tool ensures 99.99% accuracy by comparing information across multiple sources. It generates an analyze tree, making it easy to trace data back to its origin. Users gain transparent, reliable insights with clear source references, turning fragmented information into trustworthy knowledge for smarter decisions. | AWS | Provide a model that help user get the accurate information and provide source of it  |  |  |  | wenwen |
| 14 | Help me look at, you can mark a web page/ bloger/or a randome thing that you care about, AI with put a pin on it, when it has any update information it will remind you | Chrome |  |  |  | pin me when there is a flyable car invited  | wenwen |

1\. Feature Mode: Session Assistant  
This mode focuses on helping users understand and manage their entire multi-tab browsing session.  
1.1. Core Summarization & Analysis  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-1.1 | P0 | Summarize Currently Open Tabs | The user clicks the extension icon. The extension immediately processes only the tabs currently open in their active window to generate the session summary. This defines the default, most immediate "session." | This is the simplest session scope. Use the chrome.tabs.query({currentWindow: true}) API call. The requirement and UX are now aligned on this clear, immediate behavior. |  
| FR-1.2 | P1 | Include Recent History in Summary | In the sidebar, the user sees an option (e.g., a "Summarize last 4 hours" button). Clicking it re-generates the summary, now including key pages from their recent browsing history, giving a much richer context of their current task. | This requires using the chrome.history.search() API with a startTime (e.g., 4 hours ago). The main challenge is filtering out minor pages to avoid noise and intelligently merging the history results with the open tabs before the Gemini API call. |  
| FR-1.3 | P0 | Group Summary by AI Category | After a 2-4 second loading spinner, the sidebar populates with bolded category names (e.g., "Project Research"). Below each name is a concise, AI-written summary of that topic. | Core Task: Collect tab titles and URLs (from either open tabs or history). Send them to the Gemini API with a prompt asking it to cluster the items and return a clean JSON object. The main challenge is prompt engineering. |  
| FR-1.4 | P2 | Group Summary by Domain | As a simpler alternative, the sidebar would show summaries grouped by website (e.g., "youtube.com," "github.com"). | This is a fallback if the AI categorization proves too slow or unreliable. It involves simple string parsing of the tab URLs to group them before sending them for summarization. |  
1.2. UI & Presentation  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-1.5 | P0 | Display with Accordion UI | The user sees a clean list of the AI-generated categories. They can click any category to expand it, revealing the list of individual tabs (with their website icon and title) within that group. | This is a standard front-end task. Use basic JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the tab lists. No external libraries are needed, making it fast to implement. Use CSS for smooth transitions. |  
1.3. Active Organization  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-1.6 | P1 | Organize into Tab Groups | The user sees a prominent "✨ Organize Tabs" button. Clicking it provides instant gratification as their messy tab bar magically rearranges into colored, named groups matching the AI categories. | Use the chrome.tabs.group() API. You'll need to map your AI categories to tab IDs and then make asynchronous calls to group them. The main challenge is managing these calls without errors. |  
| FR-1.7 | P2 | Organize into New Windows | Beside each category in the sidebar, a "move" icon would allow the user to shift all tabs of that category into a completely new window, decluttering their main workspace. | Use chrome.windows.create() to make a new window, then use chrome.tabs.move() to move the relevant tabs into it. This is a straightforward extension of the tab grouping logic. |  
2\. Feature Mode: Knowledge Mapper  
This mode focuses on creating a deep, auto-expanding knowledge map from a single webpage.  
2.1. Generation & Visualization  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-2.1 | P1 | Generate Context-Aware Map | The user is on an article, clicks a "Create Map" button in the extension. The sidebar view switches, showing a loading animation, then renders a visual graph of the article's key concepts, intelligently including related concepts from their recent browsing. | Use a content script to extract text from the active tab. Use chrome.history.search() to find related pages from the last day. Send this combined context to the Gemini API with a prompt asking for a node-edge JSON output. |  
| FR-2.2 | P1 | Visualize with UML-Style Chart | The knowledge map appears as a clean, static mind map or flowchart. It's easy to read and understand the core structure of the topic at a glance. | Fastest Path to Visualization: Integrate Mermaid.js. You just need to transform the JSON output from the LLM into Mermaid's simple text syntax. This avoids the steep learning curve of more complex libraries. |  
| FR-2.3 | P2 | Visualize with Interactive Graph | The map is a dynamic graph the user can drag, zoom, and click on. Clicking a node could highlight its connections or reveal more detailed information. | This requires a dedicated library like Cytoscape.js or D3.js. The implementation complexity is high, involving significant JavaScript to configure the graph layout, styling, and user interactions. |  
2.2. Automated Content Expansion  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-2.4 | P2 | Trigger Expansion Manually | The user sees an "Expand Knowledge" button on their map. Clicking it adds new, related nodes to the graph, allowing them to visibly deepen their understanding of the topic. | Implement a function that takes key topics from the existing graph, queries an external API (like Wikipedia), summarizes the new content with Gemini, and adds it back to the graph data before re-rendering. |  
| FR-2.5 | P2 | Expand Map using Wikipedia | The expansion process prioritizes pulling structured, factual data from Wikipedia to enrich the map with reliable information. | This involves making specific API calls to the Wikipedia/MediaWiki API. The data returned is usually well-structured, making it easier to parse and integrate into the graph compared to generic web pages. |  
| FR-2.6 | P2 | Expand Map using Web Search | For topics not found on Wikipedia, the expansion process uses a general web search to find and summarize relevant articles, adding them as new nodes. | Use a search API (e.g., Google's Programmable Search Engine). This is more complex as it requires a "scrape \-\> summarize \-\> integrate" pipeline for each search result, increasing API usage and potential for noise. |  
| FR-2.7 | P2 | Notify on Map Growth 🔔 | If expansion is automatic, a subtle notification appears (e.g., "Your 'AI Models' map has grown with 3 new concepts"), prompting the user to revisit their knowledge base. | Use the chrome.notifications API to create and display a system notification. The implementation is straightforward, but the logic for when to trigger it (e.g., after a certain number of nodes are added) needs to be defined. |  
| FR-2.8 | P2 | Trigger Expansion Automatically | Run the expansion process in the background. High complexity, not recommended for the hackathon. | This requires a service\_worker and the chrome.alarms API to schedule periodic checks and expansions. It significantly increases complexity and potential API costs. |  
| FR-2.9 | P2 | Expand from Specific Node | The user can right-click on a specific node in the knowledge map and select an "Expand this topic" option from a context menu, giving them precise control over the map's growth. | This requires adding event listeners to the graph nodes in your visualization library (e.g., Cytoscape.js). The expansion logic would then be focused on the selected topic instead of the whole graph. |  
| FR-2.10 | P2 | Visualize Expansion Source | Newly added nodes from the expansion process are visually distinct (e.g., different color, dashed border). Hovering over a new node shows a tooltip with its source URL. | This is a UI/UX enhancement. In your graph data, add a source property to new nodes. Use the visualization library's styling options to apply different styles based on this property. |  
3\. Cross-Cutting Features: Utility & Persistence  
These are features that enhance long-term usability and apply across both modes.  
3.1. Core Utility  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-3.1 | P1 | Semantic Tab Search | At the top of the sidebar is a search bar. The user can type a concept like "that article about transformer models," and the extension instantly filters to show the relevant tab, even if the words aren't in the title. | A hackathon approach would be to get the text of all open tabs, and when the user searches, send the query and all text to Gemini with a prompt asking, "Which of these documents is most relevant to the query?" |  
| FR-3.2 | P2 | Focus Assistant | The user can click a "Focus" button that identifies the session's main topic and offers to minimize or close all tabs not related to it. | The logic would reuse the AI-generated categories. The implementation involves using chrome.tabs.update() to minimize tabs or chrome.tabs.remove() to close them. |  
| FR-3.3 | P2 | Share as Text/Markdown | From a "Share" menu, the user can choose to copy the session summary to their clipboard as cleanly formatted text or Markdown for easy pasting into documents or notes. | This is a front-end task. Create a function that iterates through your summary data and builds a formatted string. Use the navigator.clipboard.writeText() API to copy it. |  
| FR-3.4 | P2 | Share as Image/JSON | The user can export a knowledge map as a PNG for easy sharing, or as a JSON file to save or import later. | Most graph libraries (like Cytoscape.js) have built-in functions to export the current view as an image or the data model as JSON. This is a relatively low-effort, high-value feature. |  
| FR-3.5 | P2 | Extension Settings Page | A dedicated settings page where the user can (optionally) enter their own Gemini API key, choose a light/dark theme, and set default behaviors (e.g., default session duration). | This requires creating an options page in the manifest.json file and using chrome.storage.sync to save and retrieve settings so they persist across the user's synced browsers. |  
3.2. History & Long-Term Memory  
| ID | Priority | Requirement | User Experience (UX) | Hackathon Implementation Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| FR-3.6 | P1 | Pin Categories for Tracking | Next to an AI-generated category, the user sees a 📌 icon. Clicking it saves that topic to a "Pinned" list. From then on, related browsing is automatically saved for later review. | Requires using chrome.storage.local.set() to save the pinned topics. You'll also need a background script that listens for tab updates and uses the Gemini API to check if the new page matches a pinned topic. |  
| FR-3.7 | P2 | History as Timeline View | The user can access a "History" tab in the extension to see a list of previously saved sessions or pinned content, allowing them to revisit past research. | This involves creating a new UI view that reads from chrome.storage.local.get() and renders the saved data as a list of cards. |  
| FR-3.8 | P2 | Annotate Saved Maps | When viewing a saved knowledge map, the user can double-click on a node to add a personal note or comment. Their annotations are saved with the map. | This is a significant feature enhancement. It requires updating the graph data model to include an annotations field and implementing a UI for editing/displaying this text within the graph visualization. |  
| FR-3.9 | P2 | Search Saved History | A search bar within the History tab allows the user to perform a semantic search across the content of all their saved sessions and knowledge maps. | This is a major engineering task. It would likely require storing summary data or embeddings in a searchable local database (like IndexedDB) or a cloud service (like Supabase with pgvector) for efficient querying. |  
| FR-3.10 | P2 | Cloud Sync for Pinned Items & Maps | Pinned topics, saved sessions, and knowledge maps are automatically synced across all of the user's Chrome browsers where they are logged in. | This requires moving from chrome.storage.local to chrome.storage.sync for simple data. For larger data like maps, it would necessitate a backend database (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) and user authentication. |
