# Session Summary Chrome Extension

The Session & Knowledge Assistant is a Chrome extension designed to combat information overload and deepen user understanding. It operates in two modes: as a Session Assistant, it provides AI-powered summaries of browsing sessions and automatically organizes tabs; as a Knowledge Mapper, it generates self-expanding visual knowledge maps from any webpage. The extension transforms browsing chaos into structured, actionable knowledge.
